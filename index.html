    <p>Hi! My name is Rachael Clark and I am a Senior Product Business Analyst, specialized in agile
        development. I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Business Data Analytics from the University of
        Connecticut in 2016 and received my
        MBA from the University of Connecticut in 2018. Now, I'm learning full
        stack development in a Coding Bootcamp. You can say I've got some pretty big goals.
